  // Notes:
  // - in this simplified suspension template, we use a combined spring-damper to model the 
  //   suspension spring and shock
  // - since such a TSDA must connect two bodies and since this template does not include a
  //   lower control arm body, we have to connect the TSDA between the chassis body and the
  //   upright body
  // - the suspension is modeled here with a linear spring and a linear damper, for which we
  //   have to specifiy the spring free length, spring coefficient, and the damping coefficient
